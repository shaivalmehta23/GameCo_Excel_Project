# GameCo Analysis 

## Project Summary
This repository contains a data of GameCo's sales, with a focus to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market.

## Key Questions
- Are certain types of games more popular than others?
- What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
- Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
- How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?

## Data
Dataset used for this project: [GameCo](https://www.vgchartz.com/)

## Data Overview
The dataset covers historical sales of video games (for games that sold more than 10,000 copies) spanning different platforms, genres, and publishing studios. Important points regarding the data set:
- It tracks the total number of units of games sold (not financial figures) from 1980 to 2016.
- The numbers represent units sold in millions. When you see the number “1.2,” for instance, this represents a total of 1.2 million units sold.
